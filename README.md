<p>This personal portfolio website is a visually captivating and interactive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design features a clean and modern aesthetic, with a focus on smooth scrolling and engaging animations that enhance the user experience. The website showcases the background, skills, and projects that I've undertaken in an organized manner. Key features include a responsive layout, a fixed image that reacts to user interaction, a card-based project display with details and links, and a comprehensive skills section highlighting the technical proficiencies. The project is built using HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, and libraries like Swiper.js and Locomotive Scroll for the interactive elements.
